d-push (2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

    Upgrading from d-push 1.X versions

    The easiest way to upgrade is to follow the steps for a new installation.
    The states of d-push 1.X are not compatible and there is no upgrade path,
    but as this version implements a fully automatic resynchronisation of
    devices it should not affect the users and work without the user
    interaction.

    Since all devices will start a full resyncronisation after the upgrade it
    is recommended to do the upgrade during a period with low traffic.

    This version offers improved logging facilities, so please review your
    configuration with respect to this.
